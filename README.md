Module for interacting with RP1210 adapter drivers, following the RP1210C standard.
Contributions welcome!

While I try to provide adequate documentation, the RP1210C standard is owned by TMC, not me, and is
not reproduced here. For a complete understanding of the RP1210 standard, you must purchase and
read the official RP1210C documentation from TMC.

Official RP1210C documentation can be purchased from TMC at this link ($37.50 at time of writing):
